              I'm Giulia Rubini, born and raised in Milan - ITALY,
              where you breathe fashion as soon as you step out of
              your home.

              I followed my dream and I graduated in Fashion Design
              from NABA, an international university, where I grow in
              a mix of different cultures with people from every part
              of the world.

              While studying, I worked as a sales assistant because I
              wanted to be more economically independent but also because
              I've always been curious and I wanted to understand
              customers and the final part of the fashion production
              process.

              During my last semester, I was selected for a special
              project about sustainability with the fashion designer
              Tiziano Guardini. Together, we created a capsule collection
              that was displayed at various fashion shows, including
              the NABA Fashion Show and Sustainable Visions
              Fashion Show 2019.

              As a Fashion Designer, my goal is to create fresh and
              cool designs that suit the needs of the customers without
              loosing any details. I had experience working with
              denim and pants, trims, prints, hangtags and waist tag.
              I'm really curious and willing to explore other categories,
              countries and continuing to learn and improve everyday.
